          <p> My name is Jill Pohjonen and I am currently a part time student in the University of Wisconsin's Online Masters Program in GIS and Web
          Programming. I'm anticipating completion of the program in June of 2020.
          </p>
          <p> I have been a hydrologist with the State of Minnesota for 20 years, doing a variety of surface water projects that involve mapping or 
          spatial analysis component. My undergraduate degree work was in Natural Resources and Environmental Studies at the University of Minnesota. 
          I have worked both in our State Department of Transportation and with our Department of Natural Resources over the course of my career.
          </p>
          <p>In my current position with the DNR, I work as a floodplain hydrologist.  I assist our State Mapping Engineer with hydraulic modeling and mapping
          related to FEMA floodplain projects.  I also am responsible for producing the final spatial floodplain related products we send to FEMA. I prepare all the
          spatial for its home in a geodatabase, adhering to all of FEMA's guidelines and standards in the process.  I also do spatial analysis related to 
          mapping and other concerns, as well as produce all of our online mapping content with ArcGIS Online.  
          </p>
          <p> I have many years of GIS experience in the natural resources field. GIS has been the common thread in every job I've ever had. The irony is that in my undergraduate work, I only took 1 GIS course!  There were not a lot of course choices in 1996 when I was finishing my degree.  All my experience has been gained by self teaching, collaboration, or through employer paid training.  Lately, however, I've felt the desire to gain more formal skills to push myself over the proverbial career hump.  This led me to the program at University of Wisconsin.  In just my second semester, I already have gained many new skills and exposure to new concepts and ideas. I look forward to the rest of my studies here. 
          </p>
          <p> In my spare time, I enjoy riding my motorcycle, hanging out with my sisters and nieces, reading, and always finding ways to scratch my itch to learn new things. 
          </p>    
          <p> If you are interested in learning more about my work history and experiences, my resume is available <a href="assets/resume.docx"><strong>here.</strong></a>
